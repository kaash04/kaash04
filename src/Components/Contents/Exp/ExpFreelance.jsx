                Worked with all kinds of people—some knew what they wanted, some just wanted it yesterday. Learned to nod, smile, and Google things really fast.

                Tried a bunch of algorithms. Some worked, some just made things slower. But hey, <span style={{ color: '#D1A980' }}>every bug is just a misunderstood feature, right?</span>

                Real-world projects = real-world chaos. <span style={{ color: '#725CAD' }}>Adapted, improvised, delivered</span>. Clients happy, code shipped, sleep schedule destroyed. Would do it again.
