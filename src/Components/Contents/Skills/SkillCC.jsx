                C and C++ are the backbone of modern programming—fast, powerful, and just a little bit scary. C is all about getting close to the hardware, while C++ adds a sprinkle of OOP magic (and a dash of complexity). Used everywhere from operating systems to high-performance games, these languages are not for the faint of heart. Mastering pointers and memory management is basically a rite of passage.

                I cut my teeth on C/C++—wrote my first “Hello, World!”, wrestled with pointers, and learned the true meaning of a segmentation fault.
