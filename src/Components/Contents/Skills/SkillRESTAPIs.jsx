                REST APIs are the glue of the internet—connecting apps, services, and probably even your fridge. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE: the verbs of modern web life. If you’ve ever seen a fetch call, you’ve met REST.

                Built and consumed APIs for everything from weather apps to full-stack web services. Debugging with Postman is basically a hobby now.
