                Postman is the Swiss Army knife for API testing. Send requests, check responses, and debug like a pro. Collections, environments, and a UI that makes REST a breeze.
            </p>
            <p className='educationPara'>
                Built massive collections for testing, and yes, Iâ€™ve spent way too long figuring out why a request failed (spoiler: was missing a header).
            </p>
