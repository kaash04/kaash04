                Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is all about organizing code into reusable, logical chunks. Think objects, classes, inheritance, and a lot of diagrams. Itâ€™s the secret sauce behind most modern software, making big projects less chaotic (in theory).
            </p>
            <p  className='educationPara'>
                OOP is responsible for keeping my code neat, modular, and (mostly) bug-free. Explaining encapsulation is still a work in progress though.
