                Bootstrap is the fast track to a good-looking website. Pre-built components, a powerful grid, and enough purple to last a lifetime. It’s the go-to for quick prototypes and consistent designs. If you see a familiar button style, it’s probably Bootstrap.
            </p>
            <p className='educationPara'>
                My go-to for hackathons and client projects where "make it look good, fast" is the only brief. I can spot a Bootstrap navbar from a mile away.
            </p>
