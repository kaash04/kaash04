                ExpressJS is the minimalist web framework for NodeJS. Routing, middleware, and just enough magic to keep things simple. If you want to build APIs fast, Express is your friend.

                Spun up servers, handled routes, and learned the hard way that order of middleware matters. Express makes backend feel less scary.
