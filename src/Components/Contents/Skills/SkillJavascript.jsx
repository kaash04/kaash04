                JavaScript is the language that makes the web come alive. Animations, interactivity, and the occasional mysterious bug—JavaScript does it all. It’s quirky, powerful, and sometimes confusing (thinking of, typeof NaN being Number). If it moves on a website, JavaScript is probably involved.

                JavaScript adds life to my projects, from simple click events to full-blown web apps. Still amazed by how much you can do with a few lines of code.
