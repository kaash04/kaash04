                HTML5 is the skeleton of the web—structuring everything from cat videos to billion-dollar apps. It brought us semantic tags, audio, video, and a world where divs can finally retire. If it’s on the internet, chances are HTML5 is behind it, quietly holding things together.
            </p>
            <p className='educationPara'>
                I used HTML5 to build the foundation for every project, making sure my divs, sections, and articles are in all the right places (most of the time).
