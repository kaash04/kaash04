                ReactJS is the king of modern front-end frameworks. Components, hooks, and a virtual DOM that keeps things snappy. Itâ€™s all about building interactive UIs without losing your mind (most of the time). If you see a slick single-page app, React is probably behind it.

                Built everything from dashboards to to-do apps with React. JSX feels like home, and useEffect is my frenemy.
