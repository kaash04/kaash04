                Tailwind CSS is utility-first styling for the modern web. Write classes right in your HTML and watch your site come to life. No more fighting with custom CSS (well, almost). Fast, flexible, and a little addictive.

            <p className='educationPara'>
                Built landing pages and dashboards at lightning speed. My HTML files have never looked so... crowded.
