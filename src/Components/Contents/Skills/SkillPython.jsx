                Python is the Swiss Army knife of programming—clean, readable, and ready for anything. From web apps to data science, Python does it all with fewer lines and more style. Indentation is a law, and whitespaces are sacred. If you want to automate, analyze, or just get things done, Python’s your friend.

                I used Python for quick scripts, automation, and the occasional data wrangling. It’s my go-to when I want results fast (and don’t want to fight with semicolons).
