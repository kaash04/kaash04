                APIs are the messengers of the digital worldâ€”letting apps, devices, and even toasters talk to each other. If it has an endpoint, it can be connected. Integration is the name of the game.

                Integrated payment gateways, social logins, and more. Sometimes I even read the docs (but only if I have to).
