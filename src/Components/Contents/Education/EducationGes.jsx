                Two years of a masterclass in doing just enough. I perfected the art of starting assignments the night before (or, let’s be honest, the morning of) and somehow always managing to submit them on time—give or take a few minutes.

            <p className='educationPara'>
                I became an <span style={{ color: '#725CAD' }}>expert in strategic procrastination</span>, turning "I’ll do it later" into a lifestyle. Group projects? I was there for moral support (and maybe the snacks), but I always made sure my name was on the final submission.
            </p>
            <p className='educationPara'>
                Despite my laid-back approach, I somehow managed to keep up—proving that sometimes, winging it is a skill in itself. Gurukul taught me that you don’t always have to stress to get things done (but a little bit of last-minute panic does help).
