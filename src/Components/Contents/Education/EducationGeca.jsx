                Three years (and counting) of deciphering cryptic compiler errors, surviving all-nighters, and discovering that Stack Overflow is, in fact, a legitimate study resource. At GCE Aurangabad, I’ve become a professional at turning “<span style={{ color: '#725CAD' }}>it works on my machine</span>” into a lifestyle.
            </p>
            <p className='educationPara'>
                Joined <span style={{ color: '#D1A980' }}>HackSlash</span> (the college’s coding club) and <span style={{ color: '#D1A980' }}>Google Developer Student Club</span> — organized events, mentored juniors and learned that "refreshments provided" is the best way to fill a room.
            </p>
            <p className='educationPara'>
                As <span style={{ color: '#D1A980' }}>Joint Technical Secretary for the Computer Science Student’s Association</span> (2024–2025), I mastered the balance of leadership, last-minute event planning, and pretending to know what’s going on during meetings (pro tip: nod and take notes).

            <p className='educationPara'>
                Led CP & DSA sessions for freshers, turning “what even is recursion?” into “oh, that’s why my code crashed.”
